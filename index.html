      <div class="skill">
        <img src="images/icons/js.png"alt="" class="icon">
        <h4 class="skill">Vanilla JavaScript</h4>
        <p class="skill-description">I started learning JavaScript as part of my journey into front-end development, and it quickly became one of my favorite programming languages. I’ve used JavaScript to build interactive websites, handle dynamic content, and improve user experience with DOM manipulation and event handling. I've also worked with modern JavaScript features like ES6+, asynchronous programming using Promises and async/await, and integrated APIs to fetch and display real-time data. JavaScript has been essential in deepening my understanding of frameworks like React, which I actively use in my projects.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill">
        <img src="images/icons/react.png"alt="" class="icon">
        <h4 class="skill">React</h4>
        <p class="skill-description">Working with React has significantly enhanced my front-end development skills. I started with the basics—components, props, and state—and gradually built more complex user interfaces using hooks, context, and React Router. What I enjoy most about React is its modularity and efficiency in building dynamic, responsive web applications. Through personal projects and continuous learning, I’ve become confident in building modern, single-page applications that are both functional and user-friendly. React has become my go-to library for front-end development</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill">
        <img src="images/icons/nodejs.png"alt="" class="icon">
        <h4 class="skill">Node.js</h4>
        <p class="skill-description">I have hands-on experience working with Node.js to build fast and scalable backend applications. I’ve used Node.js along with Express.js to create RESTful APIs, handle server-side logic, and manage databases like MongoDB. My work includes building authentication systems, handling file uploads, and deploying full-stack applications. I enjoy using Node.js for its non-blocking architecture and strong community support</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill">
        <img src="images/icons/mongo.png"alt="" class="icon">
        <h4 class="skill">MongoDB</h4>
       <p class="skill-description">As a front-end developer, I’ve used MongoDB in several full-stack projects to manage and store data efficiently. I appreciate its flexibility with JSON-like documents, which integrates smoothly with JavaScript and modern frameworks like React. I’ve worked with MongoDB to build dynamic user interfaces that rely on real-time data and have experience using it alongside Express and Node.js in the MERN stack. Whether managing user authentication, storing form submissions, or handling product data, MongoDB has helped me build scalable and responsive applications</p>
